index.htmlFileHello. I need you to, using inline and internal CSS, take the provided piece of HTML code and recreate the image of the website provided. You should not alter the HTML code but only add CSS elements. The entire background should be lightblue and each div section should sit on the background like a bubble, with space between each section and rounded corners. The div section with id="header" should have a gradient blue color background with the <h1> centered and the <p> not centered, both using the correct font. The <div id="main-content"> section should have a white background. The "important" class should be highlighted blue. The <div id="quiz-section"> should be colored with a lighter blue background. The <h2> element and image should be on the left side while the form section is on the right. The <div id="species-table"> section below that should not have a background color. The background colors of the rows of the table inside it should be colored gray, no background color, and white. Finally, the <div id="footer"> section should be colored dark blue background with rounded corners. 

## RESPONSE 1

Here is the CSS code to apply the requested styling using inline and internal CSS. I'll integrate it directly into the `<head>` section of your provided HTML file as internal CSS.

## RESPONSE 2

I have added the required CSS directly into the HTML file using internal styles, ensuring the layout and design match the provided specifications. Let me know if you need any additional tweaks or further assistance!

## PROMPT 2

Can you add comments explaining what you did at each spot. Can you make every element <h2> through <h6> blue in font color and every element <h1> through <h6> in times new roman font. Also make the bullets in the unordered list colored blue. In the <div id="quiz-section"> section, stack the <h2> and image on top of each other and place the input boxes below their labels. 

## RESPONSE 3

The requested changes have been implemented, including comments explaining the CSS styling, adjusting all headings to Times New Roman with blue coloring for `<h2>` through `<h6>`, blue-colored bullets in the unordered list, and reformatting the quiz section to stack the image and heading while aligning the inputs vertically. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

Focusing on this segment of code, I need the <h2> Octopus Quiz element to be on the left side of the screen and beneath it is the image, which has a purple frame around it. Then across from those on the right side is the form section. The labels should be above the input areas with their text colored blue, and the input boxes should have a blue outline with rounded corners. The submit button should be below the input. Use the picture and code section provided:  <!-- Fun Experiment: Octopus Quiz -->
        <div id="quiz-section">

            <!-- Image and Quiz Heading stacked vertically -->
             <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Octopus Quiz</h2>
            <img src="octopus-image.png" alt="Image of an octopus" width="100" style="border-width: 40px; border-color: purple;">

            <form action="/submit-quiz" method="POST">
                <!-- Question 1 -->
                <label for="question1">How many hearts does an octopus have?</label>
                <input type="text" id="question1" name="question1">

                <!-- Question 2 -->
                <label for="question2">Can octopuses change color? (Yes/No)</label>
                <input type="text" id="question2" name="question2">

                <input type="submit" value="Submit Quiz">
            </form>
        </div>

## RESPONSE 4

The quiz section layout has been updated as requested. The `<h2>` element and the image are now aligned vertically on the left side, with a purple frame around the image. The form is positioned on the right, with blue-colored labels above the input fields. The input boxes have a blue outline and rounded corners, and the submit button is properly styled. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
